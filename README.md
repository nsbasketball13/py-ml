Azdev ML Challenge!


Python and Machine learning!

Using   http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/index.html databases or any of your liking.
And Jupyter notebook (http://jupyter.org/ )

This project is to help get your feet wet with python and machine learning using Jupyter notebook. 
The Goal: Using the database code examples provided in the link above pick whichever you like the most and try and figure out how it works and what does changing the code does to the machine learning. Provide some kind of graphical explanation of the data (Jupyter notebook allows you to display the graph) whatever else you learn show it during your presentation so others can learn.
